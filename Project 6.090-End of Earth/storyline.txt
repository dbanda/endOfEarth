30000 BC

In the time of war and famine, global warming and strife,
the inhabitants of earth experienced a drought never before seen by man
their animals and livestock died
the heat of their planet became unbearble
their numbers dwindled
their children died
their air became un breathable
IT WAS TIME TO DISCOVER A NEW PLANET!!!!
